# TurboRef

TurboRef is an Excel add-in which can provide hints of closest translations when you're translating the cells in a spreadsheet.

## Why

Some documents come in as spreadsheets, with the texts being HTML wrapped in cells. This is unwieldy if you want to ensure consistency throughout the document.

This add-in shows the exact or closest translation when you jump from cell to cell in the document.

This was inspired by the [late Google Translator Toolkit](https://9to5google.com/2019/12/02/google-translator-toolkit-shutdown/), but it works straight in Excel!
